GGCChat
=======
A simple Server/Client chat program

TODO
=====
- Need to implement a GUI for the client
- Allow clients to customize a little bit (text color?)
- Create a special "Admin" account for remotely administering a chat
- Create commands "/kick, /ban, etc."
- Possibly use a home server to run the server code?

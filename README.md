GGCChat
=======
A simple Server/Client chat program

Building
---------
To build you need Apache [Ant][http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi]
After setting up ant to run on the command line run
ant build to compile or
ant jars to create jar files for the server and client

TODO
=====
- Need to implement a GUI for the client
- Allow clients to customize a little bit (text color?)
- Create a special "Admin" account for remotely administering a chat
- Create commands "/kick, /ban, etc."
- Possibly use a home server to run the server code?
